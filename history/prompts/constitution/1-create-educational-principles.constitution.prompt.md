## Prompt

Create principles for building an educational AI/Robotics textbook using
Docusaurus. Focus on:
1. Clear, progressive learning structure from basics to advanced topics
2. Practical, hands-on examples and code snippets
3. Comprehensive coverage of ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac
4. Student-friendly explanations with real-world applications
5. Proper documentation standards and consistent formatting
6. Accessibility and readability for diverse learning backgrounds

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution document for the Physical AI Textbook project with six core principles covering progressive learning structure, hands-on practice integration, comprehensive technology coverage, student-focused pedagogy, documentation excellence, and multi-modal accessibility. Also included technical standards for Docusaurus compliance, code quality, and cross-platform compatibility, plus development workflow guidelines.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new project constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md with 6 core principles and supporting guidelines
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with educational AI/Robotics textbook principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with textbook content development following established principles
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides solid foundation for educational content development with focus on accessibility and practical learning
