# Unity Setup Instructions

This page provides detailed instructions for setting up Unity, the real-time 3D development platform that will be used for high-fidelity rendering and simulation in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Unity will be used for creating digital twins and advanced visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Unity, ensure you have:

- Compatible operating system (Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Ubuntu 20.04+)
- Adequate hardware (see [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements) for Unity-specific requirements)
- Internet connection for downloading packages
- At least 20GB of free disk space
- Graphics card with DirectX 10, OpenGL 3.3, or Metal support

## Unity Installation

### 1. Download Unity Hub

Unity Hub is the recommended way to manage Unity installations:

1. Go to [Unity's download page](https://unity.com/download)
2. Download Unity Hub for your operating system
3. Install Unity Hub following the platform-specific instructions

### 2. Create Unity Account

1. Launch Unity Hub
2. Sign in with an existing Unity ID or create a new account
3. Select the Personal plan (free for students and individuals earning less than $100k annually)

### 3. Install Unity Editor

1. In Unity Hub, go to the "Installs" tab
2. Click "Add" to install a new version of Unity
3. Select Unity 2022.3 LTS (Long Term Support) or later - this is recommended for stability
4. Choose the following modules during installation:
   - Android Build Support (if targeting Android)
   - iOS Build Support (if targeting iOS)
   - Linux Build Support (if targeting Linux)
   - Visual Studio Community (recommended IDE integration)

### 4. Install Isaac Unity Plugin

For integration with NVIDIA Isaac, install the Isaac Unity Plugin:

1. In Unity Hub, go to the "Projects" tab
2. Click "New Project" and create a basic 3D project
3. In the Unity Editor, go to Window → Package Manager
4. Click the "+" button and select "Add package from git URL..."
5. Enter the Isaac Unity Plugin repository URL (available through NVIDIA Developer Portal)

## Unity with Isaac Integration

### NVIDIA Isaac Unity Plugin Setup

To use Unity with NVIDIA Isaac for robotics simulation:

1. Download the Isaac Unity Plugin from the [NVIDIA Developer Portal](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac)
2. Import the package into your Unity project:
   - In Unity Editor, go to Assets → Import Package → Custom Package
   - Select the downloaded Isaac Unity Plugin package
   - Import all assets

### Setting Up Isaac Robotics Components

After installing the Isaac Unity Plugin:

1. Create a new Unity scene
2. Add Isaac-specific components to your scene:
   - Isaac ROS Bridge component for ROS 2 communication
   - Isaac-specific sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
   - Physics materials configured for robotics simulation

## Verification Steps

After installation, verify that Unity is working properly:

### 1. Test Unity Installation

1. Launch Unity Hub
2. Create a new 3D project
3. Verify that the editor opens without errors
4. Test basic functionality (scene creation, object manipulation, etc.)

### 2. Test Isaac Integration (if installed)

1. Create a new scene in Unity
2. Add an Isaac ROS Bridge component to the scene
3. Verify that Isaac-specific assets are available in the Package Manager
4. Test communication with ROS 2 nodes if available

### 3. Performance Test

Create a simple scene with basic objects to verify performance:

1. Create a new 3D project
2. Add a few primitive objects (cube, sphere, plane)
3. Test scene rendering and interaction
4. Verify that the editor runs smoothly

## Unity Project Structure for Robotics

### Recommended Project Organization

For robotics projects in Unity, organize your project as follows:

```
Assets/
├── Models/           # 3D models for robots and environments
├── Materials/        # Materials and textures
├── Scenes/           # Unity scenes for different environments
├── Scripts/          # C# scripts for robot control and simulation
├── Plugins/          # Third-party plugins (Isaac, ROS, etc.)
├── Prefabs/          # Reusable robot and environment prefabs
└── Resources/        # Additional assets and configurations
```

### Creating Robot Prefabs

To create reusable robot models:

1. Import your robot model (FBX, OBJ, or other supported formats)
2. Add appropriate colliders for physics simulation
3. Set up joints and constraints for articulation
4. Create a prefab by dragging the model to the Prefabs folder

## Unity for Robotics Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

For optimal performance in robotics simulation:

1. **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Use LOD groups for complex models
2. **Occlusion Culling**: Enable occlusion culling for large environments
3. **Lighting**: Use baked lighting for static objects
4. **Batching**: Enable static and dynamic batching
5. **Shader Complexity**: Use simpler shaders when possible

### Physics Configuration

For accurate robotics simulation:

1. Set appropriate physics time steps (typically 0.02 or smaller)
2. Configure collision detection settings appropriately
3. Use proper mass and drag values for realistic physics
4. Consider using PhysX settings optimized for robotics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Unity Hub won't install:**
- Check system requirements
- Ensure you have administrative privileges
- Disable antivirus temporarily during installation

**Unity Editor crashes:**
- Update graphics drivers
- Check for sufficient RAM and disk space
- Verify graphics card compatibility

**Isaac Plugin won't import:**
- Ensure you have the correct version of Unity
- Check NVIDIA Isaac license requirements
- Verify internet connection during import

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce scene complexity
- Lower graphics quality settings
- Close other applications to free up resources

### Graphics Settings

If experiencing rendering issues:

1. Go to Edit → Project Settings → Graphics
2. Try using a different render pipeline (Built-in, URP, or HDRP)
3. Adjust quality settings in Edit → Project Settings → Quality

## Unity Resources for Robotics

### Useful Packages for Robotics:

- **Unity Robotics Hub**: Centralized access to robotics tools
- **Unity ML-Agents**: For reinforcement learning applications
- **Unity Perception**: For synthetic data generation
- **ROS#**: For ROS communication (alternative to Isaac)

### Documentation and Learning:

- [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)

- [NVIDIA Isaac Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/isaac/)

## Integration with Other Tools

### ROS 2 Communication

Unity can communicate with ROS 2 through:

1. **Isaac ROS Bridge**: Official NVIDIA integration
2. **ROS#**: Third-party Unity package
3. **Custom TCP/UDP connections**: For custom implementations

### Simulation Workflows

Unity can be used in combination with:

- Gazebo for physics validation
