# NVIDIA Isaac Setup Instructions

This page provides detailed instructions for setting up NVIDIA Isaac, the simulation and development platform for robotics that will be used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Isaac provides photorealistic simulation and advanced AI capabilities for robotics development.

## Prerequisites

Before installing NVIDIA Isaac, ensure you have:

- NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 6.0 or higher (GeForce GTX 1060 or better recommended)
- Compatible NVIDIA drivers (version 470 or later)
- CUDA 11.8 or later installed
- cuDNN 8.6 or later installed
- Compatible operating system (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Windows 10/11, or macOS 12+)
- Adequate hardware (see [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements) for Isaac-specific requirements)
- Internet connection for downloading packages
- At least 30GB of free disk space

## System Preparation

### 1. Install NVIDIA Drivers

For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
sudo reboot
```

For Windows: Download and install the latest Game Ready or Studio drivers from [NVIDIA's website](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers/)

### 2. Install CUDA Toolkit

Download CUDA 12.3 from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads):

For Ubuntu:
```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.3.0/local_installers/cuda_12.3.0_545.23.06_linux.run
sudo sh cuda_12.3.0_545.23.06_linux.run
```

Follow the installer prompts, ensuring to install the CUDA Toolkit while potentially skipping the driver installation if you already have compatible drivers.

### 3. Install cuDNN

Download cuDNN from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (requires free developer account):

For Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i libcudnn8_*.deb
sudo dpkg -i libcudnn8-dev_*.deb
```

## Isaac Sim Installation

### Option 1: Isaac Sim Omniverse Extension (Recommended)

Isaac Sim is available as an extension in NVIDIA Omniverse:

1. Download and install [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/)
2. Launch Omniverse Create or Isaac Sim directly
3. In the Extension Manager, search for "Isaac Sim" and install
4. Restart Omniverse to complete the installation

### Option 2: Standalone Isaac Sim

1. Go to [NVIDIA Isaac Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim)
2. Download Isaac Sim for your platform
3. Extract and run the installation script

For Ubuntu:
```bash
# Extract the downloaded package
tar -xzf isaac-sim-*.tar.gz
cd isaac-sim-*
./install.sh
```

### Option 3: Isaac Sim via Docker (Alternative)

For containerized deployment:

```bash
# Pull the Isaac Sim Docker image
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:latest

# Run Isaac Sim container
docker run --gpus all -it --rm --network=host \
  --env "DISPLAY" \
  --env "QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
  --volume "/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
  --volume "/home/$USER:/workspace:rw" \
  --volume "/dev/shm:/dev/shm" \
  --privileged \
  --pid=host \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:latest
```

## Isaac ROS Integration

### Install Isaac ROS Packages

To integrate Isaac with ROS 2:

```bash
# Install Isaac ROS dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-isaac-ros-gem ros-humble-isaac-ros-message-converter
sudo apt install ros-humble-isaac-ros-visual- slam ros-humble-isaac-ros-people-segmentation
sudo apt install ros-humble-isaac-ros-ros-bridge
```

### Verify Isaac ROS Installation

Test the Isaac ROS bridge:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 launch isaac_ros_ros_bridge isaac_ros_bridge.launch.py
```

## Verification Steps

After installation, verify that Isaac is working properly:

### 1. Test Isaac Sim Installation

Launch Isaac Sim:

```bash
# If using Omniverse
omniverse://exts/omni.isaac.sim.python/isaac-sim.py

# Or if installed standalone
cd ~/isaac-sim
./isaac-sim.sh
```

### 2. Test Basic Simulation

1. Launch Isaac Sim
2. Load a basic scene (e.g., a simple robot in an environment)
3. Verify that the physics simulation runs correctly
4. Check that the rendering appears properly with lighting and textures

### 3. Test ROS Integration

If Isaac ROS packages are installed:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch Isaac Sim with ROS bridge
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 launch isaac_ros_ros_bridge isaac_ros_bridge.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Test communication
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```

You should see topics from Isaac Sim in the ROS 2 system.

## Isaac Sim Configuration

### Basic Configuration

1. Launch Isaac Sim
2. Go to Window → Isaac Examples → Basic RL Scene
3. Load the example scene to verify functionality
4. Adjust settings in Window → Settings → Isaac Sim

### Performance Settings

For optimal performance:

1. Go to Window → Settings → Isaac Sim
2. Adjust rendering quality based on your hardware

1. Import robot URDF or USD files
2. Configure joint properties and actuators
3. Add sensors to the robot model
4. Test robot kinematics and dynamics
5. Validate sensor outputs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Isaac Sim won't launch:**
- Check that your GPU meets the minimum requirements
- Verify NVIDIA drivers are properly installed
- Ensure CUDA is correctly installed and accessible
- Check for sufficient disk space and memory

**CUDA errors during launch:**
- Verify CUDA version compatibility with Isaac Sim
- Check that cuDNN is properly installed
- Ensure your GPU has sufficient VRAM
- Try running with a different CUDA version if available

**ROS bridge not connecting:**
- Verify ROS 2 Humble is installed and sourced
- Check that Isaac ROS packages are installed
- Ensure both systems use the same DDS implementation
- Verify network connectivity if running on different machines

**Poor performance:**
- Lower rendering quality settings
- Reduce the complexity of your environment
- Check that your GPU has sufficient VRAM
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for optimal Isaac Sim performance:

```bash
export ISAAC_SIM_PATH=~/isaac-sim
export NVIDIA_DISABLE_REQUIRE_CUDA=1  # If needed for compatibility
export OMNI_LOG_LEVEL=warning  # Reduce logging verbosity
```

## Isaac Sim Best Practices

### Simulation Accuracy

1. Use appropriate physics parameters for your robot
2. Configure realistic sensor noise models
3. Validate simulation results against real-world data
4. Use multiple simulation scenarios for testing

### Performance Optimization

1. Use proxy representations during scene setup
2. Optimize asset complexity for your target frame rate
3. Use level of detail (LOD) for complex models
4. Configure appropriate physics substeps

## Integration with Other Tools

### Unity Integration

Isaac Sim can export scenes to Unity:

1. Export scenes in USD format from Isaac Sim
2. Import USD files into Unity using the USD Package
3. Configure materials and lighting appropriately

### Gazebo Comparison

While Isaac Sim provides photorealistic rendering, consider using Gazebo for:

- Faster physics-only simulation
- Simpler robot models
- Deterministic testing environments
