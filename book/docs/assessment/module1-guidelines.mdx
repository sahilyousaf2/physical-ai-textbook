# Module 1 Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

Module 1: "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" focuses on understanding the core architecture of ROS 2 and how to implement basic robotics communication patterns. This module covers fundamental concepts including nodes, topics, services, and Python integration with rclpy.

## Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Explain the core architecture of ROS 2 and its advantages over ROS 1
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes in both Python and C++
- Implement publishers and subscribers for topics
- Create and use services for request/response communication
- Work with parameters in ROS 2 nodes
- Use callbacks and timers effectively in Python nodes

## Assessment Criteria

### Practical Assessment (70%)

Students will complete the following practical exercises:

1. **Node Creation Exercise**: Create a ROS 2 node that implements both a publisher and subscriber
   - Criteria: Node properly initializes, creates publisher/subscriber, and runs without errors
   - Weight: 25%

2. **Service Implementation**: Create a service server and client that performs a simple calculation
   - Criteria: Service properly handles requests, client correctly calls the service
   - Weight: 25%

3. **Parameter Management**: Create a node that declares and uses parameters with dynamic reconfiguration
   - Criteria: Parameters properly declared, values correctly retrieved and used
   - Weight: 20%

### Theoretical Assessment (30%)

Students will complete a written assessment covering:

1. Differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2 architecture
2. QoS policies and their applications
3. When to use topics vs services
4. The role of DDS in ROS 2

## Grading Rubric

### Excellent (A, 90-100%)
- All practical exercises function correctly with no errors
- Code is well-commented and follows best practices
- Theoretical concepts are clearly explained with examples
- Demonstrates deep understanding of ROS 2 architecture

### Proficient (B, 80-89%)
- Practical exercises work with minor issues
- Code is generally well-structured
- Theoretical concepts are explained correctly
- Shows good understanding of ROS 2 architecture

### Satisfactory (C, 70-79%)
- Practical exercises work but with some errors or limitations
- Code follows basic structure but lacks optimization
- Theoretical concepts are understood but explanations are basic
- Shows adequate understanding of ROS 2 architecture

### Needs Improvement (D/F, &lt;70%)
- Practical exercises have significant errors or don't work
- Code has structural problems
- Theoretical concepts are not well understood
- Shows limited understanding of ROS 2 architecture

## Resources for Assessment

- [ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)
- Module 1 content pages
- Exercise solutions and examples
- ROS 2 tutorials

## Instructor Notes

- Encourage students to test their nodes thoroughly
- Provide feedback on code structure and documentation
- Consider peer review for code quality assessment
- Use simulation environments for testing when physical robots are not available
