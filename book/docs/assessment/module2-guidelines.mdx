# Module 2 Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

Module 2: "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" focuses on creating digital twins of robotic systems using physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering in Unity. Students will learn to simulate robot behaviors, sensor systems, and environmental interactions.

## Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create robot models and simulate their physics
- Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
- Develop Unity scenes for high-fidelity visualization
- Integrate Gazebo and Unity for comprehensive simulation

## Assessment Criteria

### Practical Assessment (75%)

Students will complete the following practical exercises:

1. **Gazebo Environment Setup**: Create a Gazebo world with obstacles and simulate a robot navigating through it
   - Criteria: Environment properly configured, robot moves correctly, physics realistic
   - Weight: 30%

2. **Sensor Simulation**: Implement LiDAR, camera, and IMU sensors on a robot model
   - Criteria: Sensors properly attached, data published correctly, realistic sensor behavior
   - Weight: 25%

3. **Unity Visualization**: Create a Unity scene that visualizes the same robot and environment
   - Criteria: Scene accurately represents Gazebo model, real-time visualization, good graphics
   - Weight: 20%

### Theoretical Assessment (25%)

Students will complete a written assessment covering:

1. Differences between physics simulation and visual rendering
2. Sensor modeling and noise characteristics
3. Coordinate systems and transformations between simulation engines
4. Performance considerations for real-time simulation

## Grading Rubric

### Excellent (A, 90-100%)
- All practical exercises function correctly with realistic physics
- Sensor data is accurate and properly integrated
- Unity visualization is high-quality and synchronized with Gazebo
- Theoretical concepts are clearly explained with examples

### Proficient (B, 80-89%)
- Practical exercises work with minor physics or visualization issues
- Sensor simulation functions but may have minor accuracy issues
- Unity scene is well-constructed but could have optimization
- Theoretical concepts are explained correctly

### Satisfactory (C, 70-79%)
- Practical exercises work but with noticeable physics or visualization problems
- Sensor simulation has basic functionality but accuracy issues
- Unity scene follows basic structure but lacks detail
- Theoretical concepts are understood but explanations are basic

### Needs Improvement (D/F, &lt;70%)
- Practical exercises have significant errors or don't function properly
- Sensor simulation has major issues
- Unity visualization is incomplete or incorrect
- Theoretical concepts are not well understood

## Resources for Assessment

## Instructor Notes

- Provide sample robot models for students to work with
- Emphasize the importance of realistic physics parameters
- Consider using pre-built environments to reduce setup time
- Encourage students to compare simulation results with real-world expectations
- Be prepared to assist with Unity/Gazebo integration challenges
