# Module 3 Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

Module 3: "The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)" focuses on developing AI-driven behaviors for robots using NVIDIA Isaac tools. Students will learn to implement visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM), navigation systems, and bipedal movement algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Set up and configure Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Implement VSLAM algorithms for robot localization and mapping
- Develop navigation systems using Nav2 for bipedal robots
- Integrate perception and action systems for autonomous behavior
- Evaluate and optimize robot performance in simulation

## Assessment Criteria

### Practical Assessment (80%)

Students will complete the following practical exercises:

1. **Isaac Sim Environment**: Create a photorealistic simulation environment with complex scenes
   - Criteria: Environment has realistic lighting, textures, and physics; objects properly configured
   - Weight: 25%

2. **VSLAM Implementation**: Implement visual SLAM for a robot in the simulation environment
   - Criteria: Robot correctly builds map, localizes itself, handles dynamic obstacles
   - Weight: 30%

3. **Navigation System**: Implement a navigation system using Nav2 for bipedal movement
   - Criteria: Robot plans paths, avoids obstacles, moves with stable bipedal gait
   - Weight: 25%

### Theoretical Assessment (20%)

Students will complete a written assessment covering:

1. Principles of visual SLAM and its challenges
2. Navigation stack architecture and components
3. Bipedal locomotion principles and control
4. Performance optimization for AI robotics

## Grading Rubric

### Excellent (A, 90-100%)
- All practical exercises demonstrate sophisticated AI behaviors
- VSLAM system is robust and accurate
- Navigation system handles complex scenarios
- Theoretical concepts are clearly explained with advanced examples

### Proficient (B, 80-89%)
- Practical exercises work with good AI behaviors
- VSLAM system functions but may have minor accuracy issues
- Navigation system works for most scenarios
- Theoretical concepts are explained correctly

### Satisfactory (C, 70-79%)
- Practical exercises work but with basic AI behaviors
- VSLAM system has basic functionality but accuracy issues
- Navigation system works for simple scenarios
- Theoretical concepts are understood but explanations are basic

### Needs Improvement (D/F, &lt;70%)
- Practical exercises have significant errors or don't function properly
- VSLAM system has major issues or doesn't work
- Navigation system is incomplete or doesn't function
- Theoretical concepts are not well understood
