# Module 4 Assessment Guidelines

## Overview

Module 4: "Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" focuses on creating robots that can understand and respond to natural language commands, perform cognitive planning using large language models (LLMs), and execute the capstone project of developing an autonomous humanoid robot.

## Learning Objectives

Students should be able to:

- Implement voice command recognition using OpenAI Whisper
- Integrate large language models for cognitive planning
- Design and implement vision-language-action systems
- Develop an autonomous humanoid robot for the capstone project
- Evaluate the performance of VLA systems

## Assessment Criteria

### Practical Assessment (85%)

Students will complete the following practical exercises:

1. **Voice Command System**: Create a system that recognizes voice commands and translates them to robot actions
   - Criteria: Voice recognition is accurate, commands properly mapped to actions, real-time processing
   - Weight: 30%

2. **LLM Cognitive Planning**: Integrate an LLM to generate high-level plans for robot tasks
   - Criteria: LLM correctly interprets tasks, generates valid action sequences, handles edge cases
   - Weight: 25%

3. **Capstone Project**: Develop an autonomous humanoid robot that combines all learned concepts
   - Criteria: Robot demonstrates all capabilities from previous modules, autonomous behavior, complex tasks
   - Weight: 30%

### Theoretical Assessment (15%)

Students will complete a written assessment covering:

1. Challenges in vision-language-action integration
2. Ethical considerations in autonomous robotics
3. Performance evaluation metrics for VLA systems
4. Future trends in AI robotics

## Grading Rubric

### Excellent (A, 90-100%)
- Voice command system has high accuracy and low latency
- LLM integration demonstrates sophisticated planning
- Capstone project demonstrates all capabilities at an advanced level
- Theoretical concepts are critically analyzed with examples

### Proficient (B, 80-89%)
- Voice command system works with good accuracy
- LLM integration functions well for most scenarios
- Capstone project demonstrates most required capabilities
- Theoretical concepts are explained correctly

### Satisfactory (C, 70-79%)
- Voice command system works but with some accuracy issues
- LLM integration has basic functionality
- Capstone project demonstrates basic capabilities
- Theoretical concepts are understood but explanations are basic

### Needs Improvement (D/F, &lt;70%)
- Voice command system has significant errors or doesn't work
- LLM integration is incomplete or doesn't function
- Capstone project is incomplete or doesn't demonstrate key capabilities
- Theoretical concepts are not well understood
