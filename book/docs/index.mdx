# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook for teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook is structured into 4 main modules over 13 weeks, providing a progressive learning path from foundational concepts to advanced applications.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students will learn to develop, simulate, and deploy robotic systems using state-of-the-art tools and frameworks.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create digital twins using Gazebo and Unity
- Develop AI-driven robotic behaviors using NVIDIA Isaac
- Implement vision-language-action systems for autonomous robots
- Apply advanced robotics concepts to real-world problems

## Course Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Weeks 3-5
- ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services
- Python integration with rclpy
- URDF for humanoid robots

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Weeks 6-7
- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering in Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Weeks 8-10
- Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for VSLAM and navigation
- Nav2 for bipedal movement

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Weeks 11-13
- Voice commands with OpenAI Whisper
- LLM cognitive planning
- Capstone project: Autonomous Humanoid

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, students should have:

- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Assessment

The course includes various assessment methods:

- Weekly practical exercises
- Module-specific projects
- Peer review activities
- A capstone project in the final module

## Getting Started

To get started with this textbook, we recommend beginning with the [Setup Guide](./setup.mdx) to configure your development environment, then proceeding to [Module 1](./module-1/index.mdx).
