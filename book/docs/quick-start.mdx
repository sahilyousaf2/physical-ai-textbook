# Quick Start Guide for Beginners

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! This quick start guide will help you set up your development environment and run your first robotics application in just a few steps. Follow this guide if you're new to robotics development or want to get started quickly.

## Before You Begin

This guide assumes you have:

- A computer running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Windows 10/11, or macOS 12+
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
- Sufficient disk space (20GB+ recommended)
- A stable internet connection
- Basic familiarity with command line tools

## Step 1: Install ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)

ROS 2 is the core framework for robotics development covered in this textbook.

### On Ubuntu:

1. Open a terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Add ROS 2 repository
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

# Install ROS 2 Humble
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

2. Set up your environment:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### On Windows:

Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2):

1. Install WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04 from the Microsoft Store
2. Follow the Ubuntu installation steps above within your WSL2 terminal
3. Install an X11 server like VcXsrv for GUI applications

## Step 2: Verify Your Installation

Test that ROS 2 is working:

```bash
# Check ROS 2 version
ros2 --version

# Test communication between nodes
# Terminal 1:
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

# Terminal 2 (in a new terminal):
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

You should see messages being transmitted from the talker to the listener.

## Step 3: Create Your First ROS 2 Package

1. Create a workspace directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/robotics_ws/src
cd ~/robotics_ws
```

2. Create a new package:

```bash
cd src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_first_robot_pkg --dependencies rclpy std_msgs
```

3. Build your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/robotics_ws
colcon build --packages-select my_first_robot_pkg
source install/setup.bash
```

## Step 4: Run Your First Simulation

Let's run a simple simulation with Gazebo:

1. Install Gazebo integration:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-humble-gazebo-dev
```

2. Launch Gazebo:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py
```

A Gazebo window should appear with a default environment.

## Step 5: Create a Simple Robot Controller

Let's create a simple node that controls a robot:

1. Navigate to your package:

```bash
cd ~/robotics_ws/src/my_first_robot_pkg
```

2. Create a simple publisher node in `my_first_robot_pkg/my_first_robot_pkg/simple_controller.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class SimpleController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('simple_controller')
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'robot_command', 10)
        timer_period = 1  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = f'Hello Robot {self.i}'
        self.publisher.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    simple_controller = SimpleController()
    rclpy.spin(simple_controller)
    simple_controller.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

3. Make the script executable and update the setup.py file:

```bash
chmod +x my_first_robot_pkg/simple_controller.py
```

4. Build and run your controller:

```bash
cd ~/robotics_ws
colcon build --packages-select my_first_robot_pkg
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run my_first_robot_pkg simple_controller
```

## Step 6: Explore More Examples

Now that you have a working environment, explore the following examples in this textbook:

- [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/module-1) - Learn ROS 2 fundamentals
- [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/docs/module-2) - Learn simulation
- [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](/docs/module-3) - Learn advanced AI
- [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/module-4) - Learn multimodal AI

## Common Commands Reference

Here are some useful ROS 2 commands you'll use frequently:

```bash
# List all topics
ros2 topic list

# Echo messages on a topic
ros2 topic echo /topic_name

# List all nodes
ros2 node list

# Run a node
ros2 run package_name executable_name

# Launch a system
ros2 launch package_name launch_file.py
```

## Troubleshooting Your Quick Start

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check environment setup**: Make sure you've sourced the ROS 2 environment in each new terminal:
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
   source ~/robotics_ws/install/setup.bash
   ```

2. **Verify installation**: Ensure all packages are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   dpkg -l | grep ros-humble
   ```

3. **Check for errors**: Look for error messages in the terminal output and address them one by one.

4. **Consult the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting)** for common issues and solutions.
