# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robots. You'll learn about the fundamental concepts that make ROS 2 a powerful framework for robotics development.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the core architecture of ROS 2
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes
- Work with topics, services, and parameters
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy

## Overview

ROS 2 is designed around a distributed computing model where different processes, called nodes, communicate with each other through messages. This architecture allows for robust, modular, and scalable robotics applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with command line interfaces
- Completed the setup instructions in the Setup Guide
