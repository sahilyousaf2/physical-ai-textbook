## General Troubleshooting Principles

### Before You Begin Troubleshooting

1. **Check the basics**:
   - Verify your system meets the minimum requirements
   - Ensure all prerequisites are installed
   - Confirm you have a stable internet connection

2. **Environment setup**:
   - Verify ROS 2 environment is sourced: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
   - Check that environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure you're using the correct terminal/shell

3. **Version compatibility**:
   - Confirm all tools are compatible with each other
   - Check that you're using recommended versions
   - Verify that your OS is supported

### Getting Help

- Check the official documentation for each tool
- Search the community forums and Q&A sites
- Look for existing GitHub issues or create a new one
- Verify the issue is reproducible in a clean environment

## ROS 2 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ROS 2 Commands Not Found

**Symptoms**: Commands like `ros2` return "command not found"

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure ROS 2 is installed: `ls /opt/ros/humble/`
2. Source the ROS 2 environment: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
3. Add to your shell profile: `echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc`
4. Check that your terminal is using the correct shell

#### Node Communication Issues

**Symptoms**: Nodes cannot communicate with each other

**Solutions**:
1. Verify both nodes are using the same DDS implementation
2. Check that the ROS_DOMAIN_ID is the same: `echo $ROS_DOMAIN_ID`
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking communication
4. Confirm nodes are on the same network if distributed

#### Python Import Errors

**Symptoms**: Errors importing ROS 2 Python packages

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Python 3.8+ is being used: `python3 --version`
2. Check that rclpy is installed: `python3 -c "import rclpy"`
3. Ensure the ROS 2 environment is sourced before running Python
4. Verify PYTHONPATH includes ROS 2 packages

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Node Startup

**Symptoms**: Nodes take a long time to start or discover each other

**Solutions**:
1. Check network configuration and disable unnecessary interfaces
2. Verify firewall settings are not blocking DDS traffic
3. Consider using a different DDS implementation (FastDDS vs CycloneDDS)
4. Reduce the number of nodes running simultaneously

#### High CPU Usage

**Symptoms**: ROS 2 processes consume excessive CPU resources

**Solutions**:
1. Check for infinite loops in your nodes
2. Use appropriate loop rates in your code
3. Verify QoS settings are appropriate for your use case
4. Monitor for memory leaks in long-running processes

## Gazebo Troubleshooting

2. Try software rendering: `gazebo --software-rendering`
3. Verify OpenGL support: `glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"`
4. Check for sufficient RAM and disk space

#### Slow Simulation Performance

**Symptoms**: Simulation runs slowly or with low frame rate

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce the complexity of your world file
2. Lower the rendering quality in Gazebo settings
3. Close other applications to free up resources
4. Check that real-time factor is close to 1.0

#### Physics Issues

**Symptoms**: Objects behave unrealistically or simulation is unstable

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust physics engine parameters (time step, iterations)
2. Verify mass and inertia properties are realistic
3. Check joint limits and constraints are properly set
4. Consider using a different physics engine if available

### ROS 2 Integration Issues

#### Gazebo ROS Bridge Not Working

**Symptoms**: ROS 2 nodes cannot communicate with Gazebo

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Gazebo ROS packages are installed: `ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs`

3. Verify topic names match between ROS 2 nodes and Gazebo plugins
4. Confirm the spawn service is working: `ros2 service list | grep spawn`

## Unity Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Unity Hub Won't Install

**Symptoms**: Installation fails or Unity Hub doesn't launch

**Solutions**:
1. Check system requirements are met
2. Ensure you have administrative privileges
3. Temporarily disable antivirus during installation
4. Verify sufficient disk space is available

#### Unity Editor Performance Issues

**Symptoms**: Editor runs slowly or crashes frequently

**Solutions**:
1. Update graphics drivers to the latest version
2. Check that your graphics card meets minimum requirements
3. Close other applications to free up RAM and GPU resources
4. Try using a different render pipeline (URP instead of HDRP)

#### Isaac Unity Plugin Issues

**Symptoms**: Isaac components not available or plugin fails to import

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're using a compatible Unity version (2022.3 LTS recommended)
2. Check NVIDIA Isaac license requirements
3. Ensure internet connection during plugin import
4. Verify Unity Hub and Editor are up to date

## NVIDIA Isaac Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
