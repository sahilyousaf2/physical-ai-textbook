# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on advanced AI capabilities for robotics using NVIDIA Isaac, including photorealistic simulation and intelligent navigation systems.

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for robotics development that combines photorealistic simulation with advanced AI capabilities. We'll cover Isaac Sim for simulation, Isaac ROS for perception and navigation, and how to create intelligent robot behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim environments
- Create photorealistic simulation scenes for training
- Implement Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems for navigation
- Use the Nav2 stack for robot path planning and navigation
- Develop bipedal movement algorithms for humanoid robots
- Integrate Isaac with ROS 2 systems for comprehensive robot control

## Module Structure

This module spans three weeks of content:

- **Week 8**: Isaac Sim and photorealistic simulation
  - Setting up Isaac Sim environments
  - Creating photorealistic scenes
  - Integration with robotics frameworks

- **Week 9**: VSLAM and navigation
  - Visual SLAM algorithms
  - Localization and mapping
  - Navigation stack (Nav2)
  - Path planning and obstacle avoidance

- **Week 10**: Bipedal movement
  - Bipedal locomotion principles
  - Control algorithms for walking
  - Balance and stability
  - Integration with navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (Simulation)
- A working ROS 2 Humble installation
