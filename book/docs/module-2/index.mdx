# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on creating digital twins using physics simulation and high-fidelity rendering technologies.

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore the concept of digital twins - virtual replicas of physical robots and environments that enable testing, validation, and development without requiring access to real hardware. We'll cover both physics-based simulation using Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering using Unity.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create and simulate robot models with accurate physics
- Implement sensor simulation for realistic data generation
- Use Unity for high-fidelity visualization and rendering
- Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 systems
- Validate robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment

## Module Structure

This module spans two weeks of content:

- **Week 6-7**: Physics simulation in Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering in Unity
  - Understanding physics simulation principles
  - Creating robot models and environments
  - Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs)
  - Unity integration for visualization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- A working ROS 2 Humble installation
- Gazebo installed (see [Gazebo Setup](../setup-gazebo))
- Unity installed (see [Unity Setup](../setup-unity))

## Assessment Guidelines

This module includes practical exercises that will assess your ability to:

- Create simulation environments that accurately represent real-world physics
- Integrate sensors into simulated robots
- Use simulation data to train and validate robot behaviors
- Compare simulation results with real-world performance

## Getting Started

Begin with [Week 6-7: Physics Simulation and Rendering](./week-6/) to start learning about digital twins and simulation technologies.
