# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module focuses on multimodal AI systems that combine vision, language, and action for sophisticated robot behaviors.

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems that enable robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment visually, and execute complex tasks. We'll cover voice processing with OpenAI Whisper, cognitive planning with large language models, and integration with robot control systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement voice command recognition using OpenAI Whisper
- Process natural language commands for robot control
- Integrate large language models for cognitive planning
- Decompose complex tasks into executable robot actions
- Create multimodal perception systems
- Develop comprehensive autonomous humanoid systems

## Module Structure

This module spans three weeks of content:

- **Week 11**: Voice commands and processing
  - Speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper
  - Voice command processing
  - Natural language understanding
  - Command mapping to actions

- **Week 12**: LLM cognitive planning
  - Large language model integration
  - Cognitive planning for robots
  - Task decomposition and execution
  - Reasoning and decision making

- **Week 13**: Capstone project - Autonomous humanoid
  - Integration of all learned concepts
  - Autonomous humanoid robot
  - Complex task execution
  - Performance evaluation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- A working ROS 2 Humble installation
