- **Module 4**: Voice processing, LLM planning, and multimodal interaction

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: System Integration

1. **Connect all subsystems** through ROS 2 messaging
2. **Establish communication protocols** between components
3. **Implement safety layers** and emergency procedures
4. **Create the main orchestration node**

### Phase 2: Perception Integration

1. **Fuse sensor data** from multiple modalities
2. **Implement object detection** and tracking
3. **Create environmental maps** using SLAM
4. **Establish object affordances** for manipulation

### Phase 3: Planning and Control

1. **Integrate LLM planning** with low-level controllers
2. **Implement task decomposition** and execution monitoring
3. **Create behavior trees** for complex task management
4. **Add learning mechanisms** for improved performance

### Phase 4: Human-Robot Interaction

1. **Implement voice command processing**
2. **Create natural language interfaces**
3. **Add multimodal feedback** systems
4. **Establish social interaction** protocols

## Voice-Enabled Task Execution

### Natural Language Interface

The robot should understand and execute commands like:

```python
# Example voice commands the system should handle:
"Go to the kitchen and bring me a red apple"
"Clean up the living room"
"Find my keys and bring them to me"
"Set the table for two people"
```

### Command Processing Pipeline

```python
class HumanoidOrchestrator:
    def process_voice_command(self, command_text):
        # 1. Parse command using LLM
        parsed_command = self.llm_planner.parse_command(command_text)

        # 2. Decompose into subtasks
        subtasks = self.llm_planner.decompose_task(parsed_command)

        # 3. Check feasibility with current state
        feasible = self.check_feasibility(subtasks)

        # 4. Generate execution plan
        execution_plan = self.create_execution_plan(subtasks)

        # 5. Execute with monitoring
        return self.execute_with_monitoring(execution_plan)
```

## Autonomous Navigation and Locomotion

### Multi-Modal Navigation

The humanoid must navigate using:

- **Visual SLAM**: For environment mapping and localization
- **Path planning**: For safe and efficient route finding
- **Bipedal control**: For stable walking on two legs
- **Obstacle avoidance**: For dynamic obstacle handling

### Bipedal Integration

```python
class HumanoidNavigator:
    def navigate_with_bipedal(self, goal_pose):
        # Plan path considering bipedal constraints
        path = self.bipedal_path_planner.plan_path(goal_pose)

        # Execute with balance control
        for waypoint in path:
            self.move_with_balance(waypoint)

            # Monitor stability
            if not self.is_stable():
                self.recover_balance()
```

## Multimodal Perception System

### Sensor Fusion

Combine multiple sensor modalities:

- **Vision**: Object recognition and scene understanding
- **LiDAR**: Accurate distance measurements
- **IMU**: Balance and orientation data
- **Force/Torque**: Manipulation feedback
- **Audio**: Voice command input

### Environmental Understanding

```python
class EnvironmentalModel:
    def update_environment(self, sensor_data):
        # Update object positions
        self.update_object_locations(sensor_data.vision)

        # Update occupancy grid
        self.update_occupancy_map(sensor_data.lidar)

        # Update traversability
        self.update_traversability_map(sensor_data.vision)

        # Update affordances
        self.update_object_affordances()
```

## Cognitive Planning System

### LLM-Driven Planning

The cognitive system should:

- **Decompose complex goals** into executable actions
- **Consider environmental constraints** in planning
- **Handle unexpected situations** with adaptive planning
- **Learn from experience** to improve future plans

### Plan Execution and Monitoring

```python
class CognitiveExecutive:
    def execute_plan(self, plan):
        for action in plan.actions:
            # Monitor execution
            feedback = self.monitor_action(action)

            # Handle failures
            if not feedback.success:
                recovery_plan = self.generate_recovery_plan(
                    action, feedback.error)
                self.execute_plan(recovery_plan)

            # Update world model
            self.update_world_model(feedback)
```

## Performance Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Task completion rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
2. **Execution efficiency**: Time and energy efficiency
3. **Safety metrics**: Number of safety violations or errors
4. **Human satisfaction**: User experience and interaction quality
5. **Adaptability**: Ability to handle novel situations

### Testing Scenarios

Create diverse testing scenarios:

- **Navigation tests**: Moving through various environments
- **Manipulation tests**: Picking up and moving objects
- **Interaction tests**: Responding to voice commands
- **Long-term autonomy**: Extended operation tests
- **Failure recovery**: Handling various failure modes

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
